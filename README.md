# 🎬 Movie Rating and Revenue Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **movie ratings and revenue data** through a structured data processing pipeline. The objective is to clean, transform, and derive meaningful insights from the dataset using **Alteryx, ER Studio, Talend, MySQL, Azure, Power BI, and Tableau**. The project ensures data quality, efficient processing, and visualization for actionable insights.

## 📂 Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Profiling using Alteryx**
   - Conducted a **comprehensive data profiling** process using **Alteryx**.
   - Identified **missing values, inconsistencies, and anomalies** in structured (TSV, JSON) and unstructured data.
   - Standardized **date formats, special characters, and null values** for seamless data integration.

### 2. **Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram Creation**
   - Designed an **Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram** using **ER Studio**.
   - Defined **primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships** for structured data organization.

### 3. **ETL Pipeline Development**
   - Developed **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines** for data processing.
   - Extracted and cleaned data before loading it into **MySQL and Azure databases**.
   - Applied **normalization, deduplication, and transformation rules** for optimized storage.

### 4. **Data Processing with Talend**
   - Loaded cleaned data into **Talend** for advanced processing.
   - Automated **data integration workflows** for large-scale datasets.
   - Handled **missing values and inconsistencies** before visualization.

### 5. **Data Storage in MySQL and Azure**
   - Stored processed data in **MySQL and Azure databases** for efficient querying and retrieval.
   - Ensured **data integrity, indexing, and structured storage**.

### 6. **Data Visualization using Power BI & Tableau**
   - Created interactive **dashboards and reports** in **Power BI & Tableau**.
   - Visualized **movie trends, rating distributions, and revenue insights**.
   - Enabled **data-driven decision-making** through insightful visual representations.
